The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.container {
  color: blue;
}

.container p {
  color: red !important;
}

p {
  color: green;
}
```

The unexpected behavior here arises from the interplay of specificity and the `!important` flag.  While the `p` element within the `.container` class is given a high specificity rule setting its color to red and overriding the `!important` flag will set the color to red.
